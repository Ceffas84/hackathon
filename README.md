Project developed for hackathon, in 24h, during the 13th week of Academia de Código's 22th bootcamp.<br>

### Concept && Motivation
#### Concept
Proudly is a tool for everyone that wants to be the best version of themselves.<br>
By challenging users with daily quests we intend to take them out of their comfort zone, connect people and share happiness.

#### Motivation
Inspired by Disney Princesses (hackathon's theme), more precisely [Merida from Brave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvR9YOpDG4A) movie.<br>
We decided to create a mobile app to inspire the world to be boldly brave.<br>

### How does Proudly work?
Proudly asks the user how they feel today and in which field (Social, Environmental and Intelectual) they want to improve. Based on the answers, the user will get three steps (tasks) towards the goal of improving themselves in the selected field.<br>
These steps are more or less dificult based on how the user feels today. The user has always the option to execute the step or not, but each step gives the user points.<br>
After the steps phase, user is asked to register how he/she feels now.<br>
At the end of the day, Proudly reports to the user his/her evolution.
